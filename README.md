# Stoke Prediction
Given patient information, the goal was to create a model to predict whether or not this patient is likely to experience a stroke in the future. Methods such as PCA were used in dimensionality reduction, and five different types of models were trained and tuned: Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network.
